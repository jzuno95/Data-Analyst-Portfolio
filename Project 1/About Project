# About This Project

For this project the task was to find the best performing product category and customer segment. With the data I was given access to, I created a query to find the answer, 
to which I then decided to dive deeper into what possible reasons for the outcome. With the skills I have learned, I was able to clean up the data and create queries to locate 
the exact data I was looking for. Once the exact data was found, it was transfered to Microsoft Excel, to which pivot tables were created and little adjustments were made if 
needed to the table. After the pivot tables were created, a presentation was made to be able to present all findings.
