# Tableau Project

This project was comepletely done on Teableau. To view the project, the workbook and visualization have been posted in the other files. The project objective was to find which sub region has the lowest profits and why. The project was very straightforward. Values were added into correct tabs to create the visuals. Some adjustments would be made to make the visuals more eligible. Some interactive elements were incorporated to single out specific values. A dashboard was also created to help navigate through all the visuals.
